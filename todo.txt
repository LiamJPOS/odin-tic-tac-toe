Right now I have cells
and a board. board has method to render values in console. 

I need to now
- Make a method that lets user change values in board
- render board when something changes like a value on the board changes
- stop user from changing value of cell that has already been changed
- if value of cell is 1 or 2, say space taken. Cell its self doesn't need to care what its value is. just that it has one.
-- game controller will check if cell chosen has a value or not. 
- alternate turns between 1 and 2
- change values to x or o depending on what p1 and p2 choose
- make win conditions - when a value changes, check line(s) change was made on and if there are 3 the same. 


- add UI on webpage
